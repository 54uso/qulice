Quality Police for Java Projects

  Qulice is a static analysis quality control instrument for Java projects.
  It combines all the best static analysis instruments and pre-configure them.
  You don't need to use and configure them individually any more.

  At the moment we integrate together:

   * Maven dependency analysis

   * maven-enforcer-plugin

   * Checkstyle

   * PMD

   * FindBugs

   * Cobertura

   * CodeNarc

Read about {{{./qulice-maven-plugin/index.html}qulice-maven-plugin}}
(we don't have plugins for any other builders,
only for Maven2). Read about our quality policy.

Post us a message in our {{{https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/qulice}Google Group}} if you're interested or
just curious what is it all about. Besides that, don't hesitate to
submit a ticket to Github when something doesn't work or you need more features.
